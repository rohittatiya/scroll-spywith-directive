        <p>An Indian farmer is one of the most important members of society. He is the giver of food to the people, to
          all practical purposes.

          He gets up early in the morning and goes to his fields. Nowadays in a number of states, the days of ploughing
          the fields with the help of oxen are almost over except for the farmers who are too poor to purchase a
          tractor.

          The farmer has many kinds of works to do. He ploughs his fields. He sows the seeds. He waters the fields
          regularly. He has to take care of the crops. He has to protect them against hail and frost. He has to apply
          compost and fertilizers. He has also to sprinkle insecticides and pesticides to protect the crops against
          pests and insects.The Indian farmer is a hard-working man. He works from morning till evening in the
          scorching heat and biting cold. Early in the morning he drives his oxen to the fields. He ploughs the fields,
          sows seeds and waters the plants. looks after the crops and saves them from being spoiled by stray cattle or
          wild animals. He enjoys no holiday. At noon he has his meals under a shady tree and takes a little rest. In
          the evening he returns home.

          The farmer leads a simple life. He lives in a mud house, eats simple food and wears coarse clothes. Generally
          he is illiterate. He believes in old customs and superstitions. His cattle are his most valuable property.
          Often during drought crops fail and he is in trouble. When the crop ripens, he feels happy. He reaps it,
          threshes it and takes the corn to the market. In times of a bad harvest he has little money to buy seeds and
          manure and runs into debt.

          Recently, the use of agricultural machinery and chemical manures and the provision of credit facilities by
          cooperative societies and rural banks have improved his lot and changed his outlook on life.The Indian farmer

        <p>An Indian farmer is one of the most important members of society. He is the giver of food to the people, to

          compost and fertilizers. He has also to sprinkle insecticides and pesticides to protect the crops against
          pests and insects.Most of the old farmers are illiterate. But the farmers of the new generation are mostly
          educated. Their being educated helps them a lot. They get the soil of their fields tested in a laboratory.

          Most of the farmers are not interested in free electricity and water. They rather want an uninterrupted
          supply of electricity for which they are ready to pay.

          Small farmers should also start some cottage industries. Crop rotation system and contract crop system has
          been started in some states. Such steps are in the right direction and will help the farmers in the long
          run.The Indian farmer is quite ignorant. He still follows the old methods of agriculture. Owing to t his
          poverty and ignorance, he cannot (or does not) make use of scientific implements and fertilizers as well.
          Indian agriculture is dependedent on the monsoon. Very often it fails, sometimes it destroys his standing
          crops. Thus monsoon betrays our farmers. Frequently, rains cause floods which destroy crops. Thus we see that
          poverty and ignorance are two great curses for the Indian farmer.The Indian farmer is a hard-working man. He

          Recently, the use of agricultural machinery and chemical manures and the provision of credit facilities by
          cooperative societies and rural banks have improved his lot and changed his outlook on life.The remedy of the
          Indian farmerâ€™s backwardness lies in spreading literacy among the farmers. Government should help them with
          money, implements and good seeds. There should be good arrangements for irrigation also.

          It is a matter of great pleasure that today Government is doing is best to help the Indian farmer. His
          position has now improved. He is now buying better agricultural implements, good seeds and fertilizers. The
          old out- dated plough is now being replaced by the tractor.

          In the days of English rule the farmer was in the clutches of money lenders and land lords. But now the
          position is changed. The government , co- operative societies an d banks are helping our farmers. These three
          agencies have brought revolution in rural credit.

          Distribution of surplus land, consolidation of land holdings, implementation of ceiling laws and other land
          reforms have brought about a change in the status of Indian farmer. Welfare measures like spread of education
          , electrification and supply of water, building of roads, schools and hospitals have raised the standards of
          living of the farmer. Now he lives in the pucca houses and puts on better clothes. He looks very cheerful. If
          our farmers and we should co- operate our government, the conditions of the Indian farmer will improve in the
          future.</p>
